## üìà Analysis Walkthrough & Key Findings

This project uses a dataset to analyze factors related to student placements and salaries.

### Data Loading and Initial Inspection

The analysis begins by loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and performing an initial inspection using `df.info()`. This step is crucial for understanding data types, non-null counts, and memory usage.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.read_excel('dean.xlsx')
print(df.info())
```

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Histograms are generated for all numerical columns to visualize their distributions, providing quick insights into the spread and patterns of the data.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
df.hist(figsize=(12,12))
plt.tight_layout() # Adjust layout to prevent overlapping titles
plt.show() # Display the plot
```

Further EDA delves into the relationship between placement status (`Placement_B`) and `Salary`.

```python
print(df.groupby('Placement_B')['Salary'].mean())
print(df.groupby('Placement_B')['Salary'].count())
```
**Key Insight:** The analysis clearly shows a significant difference in salary based on placement status, with placed individuals having a mean salary of $274,550.

### Deep Dive into Placed Candidates' Salaries

A subset of the data focusing only on placed candidates (`Placement_B == 1`) is created to analyze salary distribution more closely.

```python
df_placed = df[df['Placement_B']==1]
df_placed['Salary'].hist(figsize=(8,4), bins=35)
plt.title('Salary Distribution for Placed Candidates')
plt.xlabel('Salary')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show() # Display the plot

df_placed['Salary'].plot.box(figsize=(8,2), vert=False)
plt.title('Box Plot of Salary for Placed Candidates')
plt.xlabel('Salary')
plt.show() # Display the plot
```

Scatter plots are used to visually inspect potential relationships between various academic performance metrics (e.g., `Percent_SSC`, `Percent_HSC`, `Percent_Degree`, `Percentile_ET`, `Percent_MBA`) and `Salary` for placed individuals.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))
plt.scatter(df_placed['Percent_SSC'], df_placed['Salary'], label='SSC %')
plt.scatter(df_placed['Percent_HSC'], df_placed['Salary'], label='HSC %')
plt.scatter(df_placed['Percent_Degree'], df_placed['Salary'], label='Degree %')
plt.scatter(df_placed['Percentile_ET'], df_placed['Salary'], label='ET Percentile')
plt.scatter(df_placed['Percent_MBA'], df_placed['Salary'], label='MBA %')
plt.title('Academic Performance vs. Salary for Placed Candidates')
plt.xlabel('Percentage/Percentile')
plt.ylabel('Salary')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Predictive Modeling (Logistic Regression)

A **Logistic Regression** model is implemented to predict `Placement_B` (placement status) based on a selection of academic and communication-related features.

**Features (X):** `Percent_SSC`, `Percent_HSC`, `Percent_Degree`, `Percentile_ET`, `Percent_MBA`, `Marks_Communication`, `Marks_Projectwork`, `Marks_BOCA`
**Target (y):** `Placement_B`

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn import metrics

X = df[['Percent_SSC', 'Percent_HSC', 'Percent_Degree', 'Percentile_ET',
        'Percent_MBA', 'Marks_Communication', 'Marks_Projectwork', 'Marks_BOCA']]
y = df['Placement_B']

lr = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000) # Increased max_iter for convergence
lr.fit(X, y)

print(f"Model Accuracy: {lr.score(X, y):.3f}")

predict_test = lr.predict(X)
cmtx = pd.DataFrame(
    metrics.confusion_matrix(y, predict_test),
    index=['actual:not_placed', 'actual:placed'],
    columns=['pred:not_placed', 'pred:placed'])
print("\nConfusion Matrix:")
print(cmtx)
```

**Model Accuracy & Confusion Matrix:** The model achieved an accuracy of approximately **79.5%**. The confusion matrix provides a breakdown of correct and incorrect predictions for placement status.
